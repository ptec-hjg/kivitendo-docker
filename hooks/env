# automated tests, and while executing hooks.
#    SOURCE_BRANCH: the name of the branch or the tag that is currently being tested.
#    SOURCE_COMMIT: the SHA1 hash of the commit being tested.
#    COMMIT_MSG: the message from the commit being tested and built.

#    DOCKERFILE_PATH: the dockerfile currently being built.
#    CACHE_TAG: the Docker repository tag being built.
#    IMAGE_NAME: the name and tag of the Docker repository being built. (This variable is a combination of DOCKER_REPO:CACHE_TAG.)
